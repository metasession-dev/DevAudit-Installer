# Changelog

All notable changes to `@metasession-dev/devaudit-cli` are documented here. The CLI follows semver.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Native TS port of `sdlc-onboard.sh` (workstream A milestone 3). `devaudit install` no longer shells out to bash; each of the 11 onboarding steps lives in its own module under `cli/src/install/`: auth-probe, detect-stack, prompts, write-config, project, api-key, github, hooks-bootstrap, branch-protection, sync-templates, done-report. Orchestrator threads `--dry-run` (planned actions, no mutations) and `--yes` (non-interactive — reads `sdlc-config.json` for defaults). Step 10 reuses the native `syncProject()` so the sync no longer shells out to `sync-sdlc.sh` either. `DevAuditClient.listApiKeys(projectId)` was added so step 6 stays idempotent against a portal-tracked `Onboarding-issued` key. 5 new vitest cases cover dry-run, full-run with mocked HTTP+gh, missing stack, PAT rejection, and the existing-key warn path.

### Planned for v0.1.0

- Native TS port of `sync-sdlc.sh` (workstream A milestone 4) — landed in #7
- `--json` output mode tightened on every command, with a versioned event schema
- `--yes` / `--dry-run` honoured by every mutating command — `install` honors both; other commands TBD
- npm publish (private scope first)

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-18

First public commit on `metasession-dev/DevAudit-Installer`. Skeleton + working commands per workstream A milestones 1, 2, 5, 6 of [`docs/devaudit-cli/build-plan.md`](../docs/devaudit-cli/build-plan.md).

### Added

- Bootstrap (commit `48916b8`): Node/TS ESM sub-package under `cli/`, commander-based CLI, full command surface registered, common flags (`--json` / `--yes` / `--dry-run` / `--verbose` / `--no-color` / `--org`), consola logger
- `devaudit --help` and `--version` (commander default behaviour)
- `devaudit doctor` — verifies `node>=22`, `git`, `gh`, `jq`, `curl` are on PATH
- `devaudit status [path]` (commit `a133b8b`) — reads `sdlc-config.json` from a consumer project, prints stack/host/slug/source-dirs/devaudit-url/uat-state/approval-mode, and probes 10 framework files for presence
- `devaudit auth login` — interactive PAT paste flow via `@clack/prompts`, validates against `GET /api/projects`, stores at `~/.config/devaudit/auth.json` (mode 0600)
- `devaudit auth logout` — wipes the cached token
- `devaudit auth status` — verifies the cached token (or `DEVAUDIT_USER_TOKEN` env var) via portal
- `devaudit push <slug> <req> <type> <file>` — port of `scripts/upload-evidence.sh`. POST to `/api/evidence/upload` with `Authorization: Bearer DEVAUDIT_API_KEY`, multipart/form-data body. Single file or directory. Retries on 429/5xx with exponential backoff, honours `Retry-After`. All upload-evidence.sh flags preserved.
- `devaudit install [path]` — **v0 wrapper** that shells out to `scripts/sdlc-onboard.sh` with stdio inheritance. Native port pending.
- `devaudit update <version> <paths...>` — **v0 wrapper** that shells out to `scripts/sync-sdlc.sh`. Native port pending.
- 7 vitest tests
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/cli.yml` — lint + typecheck + build + test on Linux/macOS/Windows (node 22)

### Stubbed (not implemented; exit code 1 + pointer to build plan)

- `devaudit org list / switch / policy list|apply / report` — needs portal RBAC + policy engine + reporting endpoints (workstream B)
- `devaudit plugin list / install / remove / update` — needs portal plugin registry + plugin SDK (workstream D)
- `devaudit config get / set / list`
- `devaudit upgrade`
