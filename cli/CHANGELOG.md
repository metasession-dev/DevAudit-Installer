# Changelog

All notable changes to `@metasession.co/devaudit-cli` are documented here. The CLI follows semver.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.75] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **#231** — Agent-agnostic SYSTEM OVERRIDE banners on all 6 SDLC stage docs (`1-plan-requirement.md` through `5-deploy-main.md` + `implementing-an-sdlc-issue.md`). Replaces Claude-specific STOP banners with branching logic: Claude Code invokes `sdlc-implementer` skill, other agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini) ask operator for authorization and create `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` sentinel before proceeding.
- **#231** — `commit-msg` hook now checks for `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` sentinel on `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`perf` commits. Blocks the commit itself (not just the push) if the skill was not invoked. Housekeeping types exempt.
- **#231** — Agent-agnostic routing in all 4 AI rule files (`INSTRUCTIONS-SDLC.md`, `SDLC_RULES.md`, `.windsurfrules`, `CLAUDE.md`). The #199 prompt YES path and anti-pattern recovery now branch by platform instead of hardcoding Claude Code `Skill()` syntax.
- **#231** — Structural enforcement documentation added to `INSTRUCTIONS-SDLC.md` listing all enforcement layers (SYSTEM OVERRIDE banners, commit-msg sentinel, pre-push sentinel, CI provenance).

### Fixed

- **#231** — Vendor-lock bug: SSoT (`INSTRUCTIONS.md`) was hardcoding Claude Code API syntax (`Skill(name: …)`), forcing non-Claude agents to either fail or ignore the rules entirely. Now all agents have an actionable path.

## [0.1.74] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **#229** — Anti-pattern self-check section added to all AI rule surfaces (`INSTRUCTIONS-SDLC.md`, `SDLC_RULES.md`, `.windsurfrules`, `CLAUDE.md`). Names the exact failure mode where the agent manually reads SDLC workflow files instead of invoking the `sdlc-implementer` skill, with a self-check list and STOP-and-invoke recovery instruction.
- **#229** — Driver clarity rule added to all AI rule surfaces. Every substantive SDLC response must open with a driver tag (`[Agent driving]` / `[Operator driving]` / `[Blocked]`) so the operator can tell at a glance whether they need to act.
- **#229** — `sdlc-implementer` SKILL.md in-chat LAST/NEXT section now includes the driver tag as the first line, before the LAST/NEXT content.

## [0.1.73] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- **wawagardenbar-app#415** — `pre-push` hook template used bash-only constructs (`set -euo pipefail`, `[[ ]]` pattern matching) that fail under husky v9's `/bin/sh` (dash) execution model. Replaced with POSIX-compatible equivalents: `set -eu`, `case` statements for pattern matching. The hook now runs under both bash and dash.

## [0.1.72] — 2026-06-26

### Added

- **#220** — New `generate-bundled-changes.sh` script in `sdlc/files/_common/scripts/`. Scans commits since a given ref, filters for housekeeping commit types (chore/docs/ci/build/test/revert/style/perf/refactor), outputs a markdown summary. Auto-synced to consumers via the scripts sync module. Used by the new "Generate and upload bundled changes" CI step in `ci.yml.template` to attach `bundled_changes` evidence to REQ-tagged releases.
- **#226** — Pre-push hook (`sdlc/files/stacks/node/hooks/pre-push`) now checks for E2E evidence (`.e2e-gate-passed` sentinel or `playwright-report/`) before allowing pushes with UI-facing file changes. Also checks for `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` sentinel when `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`perf` commits are present. Both checks are bypassable with `--no-verify` (CI provides the unskippable safety net).
- **#226** — `e2e-test-engineer` skill now writes `.e2e-gate-passed` sentinel after a successful E2E run (or `NOT_NEEDED` reason when e2e is not required). The sentinel is gitignored and checked by the pre-push hook and `sdlc-implementer` Phase 2 step 5b.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` skill now writes `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` sentinel at Phase 0 when routing to the tracked path. The sentinel is gitignored and checked by the pre-push hook before allowing `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`perf` commits.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` Phase 1 step 9 now stamps RTM rows with `sdlc-implementer@<version>` provenance marker. `validate-commits.sh` in CI checks for the stamp and fails if missing — unskippable safety net for `--no-verify` bypass.
- **#226** — New `gitignore.ts` sync module ensures `.e2e-gate-passed` and `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` are added to the consumer's `.gitignore` during `devaudit update`.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` Phase 1 step 5b now extracts `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` from the implementation plan into `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/`. These are the CI validator's expected artefacts — without them, `validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` fails and the pre-push hook blocks the push. Includes drift management: re-extract when AC table changes.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` Phase 3 step 6b now copies `implementation-plan.md` from `compliance/plans/` to `compliance/evidence/` so the CI validator finds it in the expected location.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` SKILL.md now includes "Native agent responsibilities and re-invocation protocol" section. Documents the skill/native-agent boundary, the resume protocol (`resume REQ-XXX — <detour>, re-enter at Phase N`), idempotent state re-read on re-entry, and the "PR merged to main ≠ done" rule.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` SKILL.md now includes commit-scoping rule for SRS updates: commit subject must cite the active REQ only; other REQs appear in the body for traceability. Prevents the portal's commit scanner from associating out-of-scope REQs with the current release.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` Phase 5 now includes explicit close-out steps: update RTM to `APPROVED - DEPLOYED`, move release ticket from `pending-releases/` to `approved-releases/`, verify portal approval, commit and push the close-out. Phase 5 step 0 re-reads state on resume.
- **#226** — Pre-push hook now runs `validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` as a fourth check for tracked commits. Blocks push if `test-scope.md`, `test-plan.md`, or `implementation-plan.md` is missing from `compliance/evidence/`.

### Changed

- **#220** — `devaudit update` suggested commit message now includes `[skip ci]` so automated template syncs don't trigger CI or create portal release records. Housekeeping changes from skipped syncs are bundled into the next REQ-tagged release via `generate-bundled-changes.sh`.
- **#226** — `ci.yml.template` `register-release` job no longer creates portal release records with `--create-release-if-missing`. Release creation moved to the `upload-evidence` job (which runs after gates), so the portal never shows a release from a push where gates weren't verified.
- **#226** — `sdlc-implementer` Phase 2 now includes step 5b — E2E gate verification that halts before commit if UI-facing files changed and no E2E evidence exists.

### Fixed

- **#228** — `compliance-evidence.yml.template` and `incident-export.yml.template` had multi-line shell string assignments (`ISSUE_BODY`, `SUMMARY`, `CONTAINMENT`) whose continuation lines were at 0 indentation. This terminated the YAML literal block scalar, causing `**` markdown bold to be parsed as YAML alias references — producing invalid workflows that GitHub Actions could not load. Fixed by replacing inline string assignments with `cat <<EOF` heredocs, with content indented to match the `run: |` block. A `sed` step strips the extra indentation before the variable is used. YAML validation test added to `cli/test/update.test.ts` across all fixture variants.

## [0.1.62] — 2026-06-20

### Added

- **#186** — `feature-e2e.yml.template` now includes full E2E infrastructure: services block, `DATABASE_ENV`/`APP_ENV` env blocks, `DATABASE_URI_STEP` for dynamic port resolution, `E2E_SETUP_STEP` for pre-test seeding, dev server startup + `wait-on`, `E2E_NEW_SPECS` computation for origin tagging, and `E2E_FEATURE_TEST_STEP` block token (built by `buildFeatureE2eTestStep` in `ci-templates.ts`). Mirrors `ci.yml.template`'s E2E setup — without this, consumers with databases, seeding, or auth env vars would see the workflow fail before tests execute.

- **#170** — `e2e-test-engineer` SKILL.md now includes Phase 5½ (evidence wiring validation) between Phase 5 and Phase 6. For each in-scope REQ, checks `@requirement` annotations, `evidenceShot()` calls per AC, and `[REQ-XXX]` test title tags. Halts before Phase 6 if any check fails — prevents specs from passing Phase 6's "AC covered" check without producing portal evidence.

- **#169** — `ci.yml.template` now includes an evidence-completeness gate in the `upload-evidence` job. REQs with zero screenshots are tracked in `ZERO_Screenshot_REQS` and checked against the Playwright JSON report for tagged tests. If a REQ has zero screenshots AND zero tagged tests, the step exits 1 — the release cannot proceed to UAT with no traceable evidence.

- **#171** — `sdlc-implementer` SKILL.md now includes a cross-phase scope-expansion halt gate. Fires on any user work request while a REQ is active, in any phase (2–5). If the request doesn't map to an existing acceptance criterion, the agent halts with options: (a) file a separate issue, (b) amend REQ scope, (c) abandon. Generalises the change-request loop's scope-expansion halt to all phases.

### Changed

- **#186** — `RENDER-002` block map now includes `E2E_FEATURE_TEST_STEP` alongside `E2E_TEST_STEP`. `feature-e2e.yml.template` uses the same `stripServicesBlock` and block substitution pipeline as `ci.yml.template`.

## [0.1.61] — 2026-06-18

### Added

- **#175** — SDLC stage evidence dimension. `scripts/upload-evidence.sh` accepts `--sdlc-stage <1-5>` (validated, forwarded as `sdlcStage` form field). All CI templates now stamp the producing stage: `ci.yml` → stage 2 (implement & test), `compliance-evidence.yml` committed docs → stage 3 (compile evidence), `compliance-evidence.yml` E2E regression → event-derived stage 2 (PR) / 5 (push), `post-deploy-prod.yml` → stage 5 (deploy). Backward-compatible: absent flag = no field sent; older portals ignore it.

- **#174** — New `feature-e2e.yml.template` workflow for feature-branch in-scope E2E. Runs specs tagged with the branch's REQ on PRs to `develop`, uploads the Playwright report as stage-2 with `origin=feature` metadata so the portal can exclude it from release/UAT completeness. Registered in `CI_TEMPLATES` array for `devaudit install` / `devaudit update`.

### Changed

- **#175** — `compliance-evidence.yml` E2E regression upload now zips the full `playwright-report/` directory and uploads the `.zip` bundle instead of bare `index.html`, matching the pattern already used in `ci.yml`. Ensures screenshots and traces are included in the portal-rendered report.

## [0.1.60] — 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- **wawagardenbar-app#383** — Generated `ci.yml` workflows now run `Quality Gates` on pull requests targeting `develop`, so `gh pr checks <PR>` reports the merge-time gate before integration. Release registration and evidence upload remain push/manual-dispatch only, preventing PR checks from mutating DevAudit release records.

## [0.1.59] — 2026-06-13

### Added

- **wawagardenbar-app#378** — `devaudit update` now generates a root `AGENTS.md` pointer for Codex / AGENTS-compatible agents. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, and `GEMINI.md` all defer to `INSTRUCTIONS.md` as the single source of truth; `AGENTS.md` also reminds agents to read the relevant `SDLC/` workflow file for the current stage. `devaudit status` now checks for `AGENTS.md`.

### Changed

- **wawagardenbar-app#379** — SDLC instructions now distinguish targeted local verification from CI/UAT-owned full E2E gates. Agents must confirm local services, secrets, seeded data, auth fixtures, and browser dependencies before starting a full local Playwright run; LOW-risk docs/tooling/script-only changes use the approved targeted local checks unless the operator explicitly requests a full local suite.

### Fixed

- **wawagardenbar-app#382** — Evidence uploads now use bounded per-attempt network timeouts in both `scripts/upload-evidence.sh` and `devaudit push`. A stalled portal connection fails clearly, retries within the configured attempt budget, and no longer leaves consumer CI hanging indefinitely on "Generate and upload gate evidence".

## [0.1.58] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **#162 (regression in 0.1.56)** — `devaudit update` crashed on every invocation with `TypeError: cmd.optsWithGlobals is not a function`, introduced by the #154 dry-run wiring. commander calls an action with `(…declared-args, options, command)`; `update` has two declared args, so the `Command` is the **fourth** parameter, but the handler bound `cmd` to the third (the options object). The parameter list is corrected. A regression test now drives the **built binary** through commander — the existing `runUpdate` unit tests call the function directly and never exercised the action's argument binding, which is why 0.1.56/0.1.57 shipped broken.

## [0.1.57] — 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Node 24 GitHub Actions.** Bumped all first-party actions off the Node 20 runtime GitHub is deprecating (Node-20 actions forced to Node 24 from 2026-06-16, Node 20 removed from runners 2026-09-16). This repo's own workflows and the rendered consumer CI templates move `actions/checkout@v4 → v6` and `actions/setup-node@v4 → v6`; the templates additionally move `actions/setup-python@v5 → v6`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4 → v7`, and `actions/download-artifact@v4 → v8`. All target majors were verified to run on `node24`. Consumers pick up the updated workflow actions on their next `devaudit update`.

## [0.1.56] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

Batch fix of the bugs surfaced by the SRS reverse-engineering (Appendix A of `docs/SRS.md`, #153).

- **#154** — `devaudit update --dry-run` no longer mutates the consumer tree. The flag was parsed but never forwarded from the `update` action into `runUpdate`, so a "preview" still wrote files. It now short-circuits before the sync (mirroring `install`'s dry-run), printing the consumers it would sync and writing nothing.
- **#155** — `devaudit push` reaches parity with `scripts/upload-evidence.sh`: recursive directory upload (`find -type f` semantics), retry budget raised to 5 with a `UPLOAD_MAX_ATTEMPTS` override, unedited starter-stub skip (the "STARTER TEMPLATE" banner, #133), a base-URL drift warning that probes `/api/health`, the `releaseBranch` / `releaseTitle` (`--release-title`) / `changeType` (`--change-type`) / `gateStatus` (`--gate-status`) form fields, repeatable `--meta-key key=value`, and the client-side `--environment requires --release` / `--release requires --category` validations.
- **#156** — node `ci.yml`'s evidence jobs (`register-release`, `upload-evidence`) now resolve the DevAudit base URL from `sdlc-config.json` `devaudit.base_url` (falling back to the deprecated repo Variable `DEVAUDIT_BASE_URL`), matching `compliance-evidence.yml` / `check-release-approval.yml`. Previously the jobs were gated on the repo Variable, so a consumer that had moved base_url into `sdlc-config.json` silently skipped release registration + evidence upload.
- **#157** — python `ci.yml` uploads SAST results as `evidence_type=sast_report` and the dependency audit as `dependency_audit` (matching the node template) instead of the catch-all `audit_log`, which made the portal's SAST and Dependency panels show identical content (devaudit#387, previously unfixed for python).
- **#158** — stack/host adapter manifests are validated against their JSON Schema (`adapter.schema.json`, via Ajv) at load time; a parseable-but-schema-invalid `adapter.json` now fails loudly instead of silently rendering broken CI/hooks into a consumer.
- **#159** — `devaudit doctor`'s description now matches what it actually checks (tools on PATH + a release close-out drift check, not "auth state / config validity"); the `bootstrap-governance` docstrings quote the real starter banner ("REPLACE BEFORE COMMITTING").

## [0.1.55] — 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **Documentation overhaul (docs-only release).** Three docs PRs bundled — no CLI behaviour changes; the published tarball's bundled `sdlc/files/` snapshot picks up one minor SKILL.md edit (broken cross-reference removed in `adr-author/SKILL.md`).
  - **#150** — `npm install -g …` no longer the documented canonical CLI invocation. `npx @metasession.co/devaudit-cli@latest <command>` is now the canonical zero-install form across `README.md`, `cli/README.md`, `docs/onboarding.md`, `docs/consuming-projects.md`. Adds four new client-facing reference docs: `docs/skills.md` (the six AI skills), `docs/compliance-gates.md` (the five CI workflows), `docs/evidence-tiers.md` (Tier 1/2/3 split), `docs/e2e-test-tiers.md` (smoke/critical/regression). `sdlc-framework.md` refreshed with cross-references to the new docs. README documentation table restructured into "concept overviews / operator walkthroughs / extending the framework" groups.
  - **#152** — Stale planning docs removed (-875 lines): `docs/devaudit-cli/README.md` (pre-v0.1.0 design brief), `docs/devaudit-cli/build-plan.md` (executed engineering plan), `docs/devaudit-cli/ADR-001-language-and-distribution.md` (engineering ADR), `sdlc/article.md` (long-form essay superseded by the new client-facing docs). 8 active references scrubbed across `README.md` / `cli/README.md` / `cli/src/commands/stub.ts` / `INSTRUCTIONS.md` / `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/requirement.yml` / `sdlc/CLAUDE.md` / `sdlc/files/_common/skills/adr-author/SKILL.md` / `docs/sdlc-framework.md`.
  - **#153** — New `docs/SRS.md` (190 requirements, Given/When/Then) reverse-engineered from the CLI + framework templates. 87 Must / 72 Should / 27 Could / 4 Won't. Identified vitest 4 + msw + execa as the existing test stack; recommends an execa-against-`bin/devaudit.js` CLI-integration layer between the existing unit tests and the consumer-side smoke runs. Appendix A flags real CLI bugs / brief-vs-code divergences for follow-up.

## [0.1.54] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- **devaudit-installer#149** — `compliance-evidence.yml.template` now adds a `workflow_run` trigger that listens for completed `E2E Regression` workflow runs. A new sibling job (`upload-e2e-regression-evidence`) downloads the prior run's `e2e-regression-report` artifact via `actions/download-artifact@v4` `run-id`, derives the release version against the triggering SHA, and uploads `e2e-regression-results.json` as `evidence_type=e2e_result` + `playwright-report/index.html` as `evidence_type=test_report` against each in-scope REQ. Tier metadata (`critical` for PR-to-main, `regression` for push-to-main) ships in the `meta-key tier=…`. Closes the gap where the UAT four-eyes reviewer only saw smoke-tier evidence from the feature PR's develop merge — the broader sweep against the about-to-be-promoted integration code now reaches the portal too.

- **devaudit-installer#147** — `ci.yml.template` Upload Evidence step now scopes the screenshot glob per-REQ INSIDE the in-scope-REQs loop instead of taking one project-wide glob and uploading the cross-product against every in-scope REQ. Out-of-scope REQs' legacy PNGs whose filenames don't match `REQ-XXX-AC<n>-<slug>.png` no longer 400 against the portal's filename validator. Screenshot upload failures now feed the same `UPLOAD_FAILURES` counter that gate uploads use, so a rejected screenshot turns the step RED instead of silently warning. Caught on wawagardenbar-app where REQ-007's pre-`evidenceShot` legacy folder of 21 numbered PNGs was being globbed into every release's upload attempt and silently warning while the step reported SUCCESS.

- **devaudit-installer#143** — `scripts/upload-evidence.sh` now follows HTTP 3xx redirects (`curl -L --max-redirs 3`) so a portal host migration (e.g. `devaudit.metasession.co → devaudit.ai`) no longer breaks every consumer's CI evidence upload with `HTTP 301`. The script also probes `DEVAUDIT_BASE_URL` at startup and logs a loud `WARNING:` line when the configured base URL redirects to a different host, nudging the operator to rotate the secret. Uploads succeed in the same run because curl follows the redirect; the warning is the nudge, not a hard stop.
- **devaudit-installer#144** — Sub-skill return semantics clarified across `sdlc-implementer`, `requirements-aligner`, `adr-author`, `risk-register-keeper`. The previous literal phrasing _"Hand-off back to `sdlc-implementer`"_ read as "stop and wait for the operator" and caused the orchestrator to pause mid-Phase between sub-skill returns; the operator had to manually nudge the agent four times in one wawagardenbar-app REQ-077 cycle. Sub-skill tails now say _"Return to the running `sdlc-implementer` context"_ and `sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md` carries a new § _Sub-skill return semantics_ rule: skills run in the same invocation context, control returns synchronously, the only pauses are the explicitly-named checkpoints (Phase 1 HIGH/CRITICAL plan-approval, Phase 4 release-PR hard stop, Phase 5 separate invocation). Opt-in-to-pause, not opt-out.
- **devaudit-installer#146** — `compliance-evidence.yml.template` now routes the SoT-alignment skill artefacts (`srs-alignment.md`, `architecture-decision.md`, `risk-assessment.md`) to their dedicated evidence types instead of the catch-all `compliance_document`. Previously every per-REQ `.md` except `test-execution-summary.md` was uploaded as `compliance_document`, so the portal's framework-coverage matrix reported `SOC2.CC3.2` MISSING and `ISO27001.A.8.25` PARTIAL despite the files being present on the release — the clause predicates expect `evidence_type=risk_assessment` and `architecture_decision` respectively, not the historical catch-all. The per-REQ basename → `(evidence_type, evidence_category)` routing is now a `case` block, ready to grow for future skill-produced artefacts.

- **devaudit-installer#145** — `sdlc-implementer` Lightweight path step 7 now adapts to the project's CI trigger shape. The DevAudit-Installer-generated `ci.yml.template` defaults to **post-merge-only** triggers (`push: branches: [<integration>]` with no `pull_request:` trigger) so the previous _"wait for CI"_ instruction was unactionable on a PR (no checks would ever fire). Step 7 now reads the project's `ci.yml`, distinguishes PR-time CI from post-merge-only CI, and tells the LAST/NEXT sticky to surface the right wording (_"no PR-time checks will fire; review + merge is the gate; CI runs post-merge on `$INTEGRATION_BRANCH`"_). The Lightweight-path intro also names the default trigger shape so the agent doesn't poll a PR for checks the template doesn't trigger.

## [0.1.53] — 2026-06-09

### Changed

- **Three-tier E2E gating model** — formalises smoke (every push, ~3–5 min) / critical (PR-to-release-branch, ~10–15 min) / regression (nightly + post-merge + dispatch, full audit trail). The third tier (critical) is new; it bridges between fast smoke and full regression so release-PRs no longer wait 30+ minutes on the full pack. MoSCoW priority drives tier choice via file location: `e2e/smoke/`, `e2e/critical/`, `e2e/<area>/`. Post-merge `push: branches: [release]` runs the full regression + auto-files a `bug, priority:high` issue if a spec slipped past the critical-tier PR gate — operator triages within working hours (hotfix forward, revert, or accept-with-rationale). No automated revert; false positives + flakes + UAT-data drift are real classes that need human judgement.

  Ships as a framework convention, not a synced workflow: the framework provides a copy-pasteable reference at `skills/e2e-test-engineer/references/e2e-regression-3-tier.yml` that operators apply to their consumer-owned `e2e-regression.yml`. The framework does NOT sync `e2e-regression.yml` (consumers customise it per project) — overwriting that file is held off until the sync-survival escape hatch (#84) ships.

  Touch points:
  - `Test_Strategy.md` § *System Testing (E2E)* — new sub-section names the 3 tiers + cost philosophy + post-merge safety net
  - `Test_Policy.md` § *Risk-Based Testing* — new sub-section pins gate enforcement language ("Must in smoke + critical: pre-merge blocking; Should/Could in regression: post-merge auto-issue or accepted-with-rationale")
  - `Test_Architecture.md` § *Speed over Exhaustiveness* — cross-refs the new model as the first concrete implementation of "Strategic test selection"
  - `skills/e2e-test-engineer/SKILL.md` Phase 3 — adds a tier classification decision tree authors apply per spec; recorded in the eventual `test-execution-summary.md` § *Test design* (devaudit#50)
  - `skills/e2e-test-engineer/references/e2e-regression-3-tier.yml` — NEW reference workflow consumers copy into their own `e2e-regression.yml`. Includes critical-with-smoke-fallback selector + post-merge auto-issue logic.

## [0.1.52] — 2026-06-09

> 0.1.50 and 0.1.51 were bumped on-disk but never tagged — their contents are folded into this release to minimise consumer-side bumps. Consumers update from 0.1.49 directly to 0.1.52 in a single `devaudit update` and pick up all three of #152, #127, #50 together (Bundle C).

### Changed

- **devaudit#152** — SDLC Stage 1 hardening: the implementation plan now structurally catches the failure mode where green gates ship a feature with no UI surface that a user can reach (the REQ-030 / WGB pattern). Three additive doc edits — `Implementation_Plan_TEMPLATE.md` Section 1 (Goal + ACs) now opens with a Given/When/Then writing guide that names the format directly; Section 2 (Scope) gains a **Surface inventory** sub-section listing every user-touchable surface as `In scope` / `Already works` / `Out of scope (waived)`; `1-plan-requirement.md` Step 6 WAIT CHECKPOINT gains two new gate bullets (surface-inventory completeness + AC form) and Step 7's three test-scope heredocs (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH) carry tier-appropriate AC-writing guidance above each `## Acceptance Criteria` heading. The original REQ-030 failure mode — `AC1: schema accepts inventoryId field` passing review as a valid behavioural AC — is now structurally caught at the plan-review gate.
- **#127** — `e2e-test-engineer` skill now explicitly handles transport-layer specs (Node `fetch` against webhooks, `MongoClient` queries, `socket.io-client` assertions) that live in `e2e/` but cannot call `evidenceShot` because they have no Playwright `page` object. Skill scope clarified — transport-boundary integration tests are IN scope (the existing "API-only" exclusion means unit-level route-handler tests, not transport-boundary integration). New "Specs with no page object" sub-section names the evidence form for these specs: per-spec entry in `test-execution-summary.md` describing the asserted behaviour in operator terms, with `[REQ-XXX][ACn]` bracket convention in the test title. Release-detail "screenshots" panel showing zero entries for purely-transport REQs is correct; reviewers cross-reference the test-execution summary instead. `2-implement-and-test.md` Step 4 carries the same callout so the operator sees it at the right point in the workflow.
- **#50** — `test-execution-summary.md` now carries a `## Test design` section at the top that records the design-time decisions (layers planned vs covered, deferral rationale, skill-invocation attribution). Closes the loop with #47/#132/#133/#152: the SDLC now has a recorded trace that scope was *decided*, not implicit — schema-only changes can state `e2e N/A — schema-only, no UI yet` explicitly rather than silently shipping unit+manual. Three additive edits: `3-compile-evidence.md` Step 1a heredoc grows the new section; `e2e-test-engineer/SKILL.md` Final report directs the operator to populate it with the skill's decisions + a verifiable turn pointer. The existing Test Reports gate continues to feed on `test_report` evidence; this enriches what's *in* the file without changing the gate mechanics.

## [0.1.49] — 2026-06-09

> 0.1.48 was bumped on-disk but never tagged — its contents are folded into this release to minimise consumer-side bumps. Consumers update from 0.1.47 directly to 0.1.49 in a single `devaudit update`.

### Added

- **devaudit#131** — SDLC navigability: every long-running REQ issue now carries an always-current `LAST` / `NEXT` status sticky comment, updated by `sdlc-implementer` at every phase transition + every operator-action handoff. New `scripts/update-sdlc-status.sh` is the idempotent helper (find-or-create via marker-tagged comment; `--dry-run` for safe inspection). The skill body now invokes it at the start of Phase 1, the end of Phases 1/2/3/4, and at every Phase 5 terminal (released / change-request loop / incident). Skill body also documents the matching `LAST: / NEXT:` chat-output convention. Operators returning to a long thread can now find "what just happened + what's next" without re-scrolling. 12 new hermetic tests over the helper.

### Changed

- **devaudit#132** — `sdlc-implementer`'s e2e delegation contract is now backed by two structural gates inside Phase 2, not just MUST-prose. Step 3 requires a literal pre-test-work declaration (`Delegating e2e test work to e2e-test-engineer.`) before any `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` edit, immediately followed by a `Skill(name: "e2e-test-engineer", …)` invocation. New step 9 (before Phase 3) is a mandatory self-audit: every `*.spec.ts` in the diff must be placed in one of two categories ("authored via skill on turn N" / "mechanical edit only"), or the orchestrator STOPs and reverts. Both gates exist because the rule alone was bypassed by inertia in past runs (REQ-075 + REQ-076 receipts); the gates are scripts the agent follows, not prose it can rationalise around.

## [0.1.47] — 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **devaudit#133** — Unedited governance starter stubs (incident-report.md, etc.) no longer flip framework-coverage clauses to COVERED off placeholder content. `scripts/upload-evidence.sh` now skips any file still carrying the `STARTER TEMPLATE — REPLACE BEFORE …` banner (matches both v0.1.36+ "BEFORE COMMITTING" and pre-v0.1.36 "BEFORE GOING TO PRODUCTION" phrasings). Central guard protects every upload path — governance helper, per-REQ loop, future callers. New `SKIPPED` counter in the summary; exit code unchanged (only `FAILED > 0` exits 1).
- **devaudit#133** — `compliance-evidence.yml.template` now globs `incident-report*.md` (under both top-level and `compliance/governance/`) so real per-incident files written by `incident-export.yml` upload as evidence. Previously the exact-name match missed `incident-report-<id>.md` entirely.
- Doc accuracy: `incident-report.md.template` reflects the new behaviour — unedited stub is held back; COVERED flips only when a non-stub matches the glob.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- `derive-release-version.sh` now also resolves a bracketed `[REQ-XXX]` tag in the **commit body**, not just the subject + `Ref:` line. A "Merge pull request …" commit carries the PR title (with its `[REQ-XXX]` tag) in the body, so PR-merged requirements were falling through to the date fallback and fragmenting onto a phantom `v<date>` release at `ci.yml`'s register-release step. Bracketed-only, so unbracketed prose ("target close: REQ-002") still can't beat a real `Ref:`. Regression-tested (case 8).

## [0.1.7] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Bundled `post-deploy-prod.yml` now uploads the release ticket to the **production** environment (`release_artifact`) alongside the smoke results. Submit-for-production-review requires a release ticket in the production env (`STATUS_ENVIRONMENT[prod_review] = 'production'`), but the dev/UAT pipeline only uploaded it to `uat` — so the prod-review submission was unsatisfiable. The promoted release's ticket is now carried forward to production.

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Bundled `post-deploy-prod.yml` now resolves the **promoted REQ release** instead of a date-prefixed one. It derives the version from the commits merged into the push (`[REQ-XXX]` subject tags / `Ref:` lines, `fetch-depth: 0`), falling back to a bare date only for date-versioned consumers. Previously a REQ-versioned release never converged at the production stage — prod evidence and the `prod_review` advance landed on a phantom `v<date>` release while the real REQ release stayed `uat_approved`.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Bundled `derive-release-version.sh` now reads the release id from the `[REQ-XXX]` subject tag or the `Ref:` line only — not the first `REQ-\d+` anywhere in the commit body. A prose forward-reference (e.g. "target close: REQ-002" before "Ref: REQ-001") no longer misroutes a release's gate evidence onto a phantom release named after the wrong requirement. Regression-tested (case 7). Same greedy-prose class as the 0.1.4 validator fix.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Bundled compliance validator (`sdlc/files/_common/scripts/validate-compliance-artifacts.sh`) now scopes requirement extraction to the commit `[REQ-XXX]` subject tag and `Ref:` trailer, instead of scraping the entire commit body. Prose forward-references like "target close: REQ-002" no longer cause CI to demand evidence dirs for requirements that haven't started. New regression case in the validator test suite (17 pass). Consumers pick this up on the next `devaudit update`.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-24

> Supersedes a broken manual `0.1.2` publish whose tarball carried an unresolved
> `@metasession.co/devaudit-plugin-sdk: file:../plugin-sdk` dependency (the manual
> `npm publish` bypassed `release.yml`'s `file:`→`^version` rewrite, so `npm i -g`
> failed). `0.1.2` is deprecated; this is the same change set published correctly
> via the tagged CI release. Lockstep release across all four packages.

### Added

- **Templates are now bundled into the package.** `prepack` runs `tools/bundle-templates.mjs`, which copies `sdlc/` and `scripts/upload-evidence.sh` from the repo root into the package, and `package.json` `files` ships them. The published tarball is self-contained — `devaudit install` / `devaudit update` work from a global `npm i -g` install with no DevAudit-Installer checkout. Implements the bundling design in `docs/devaudit-cli/build-plan.md` / ADR-001.

### Changed

- `resolveInstallerRoot()` now locates templates by the presence of `sdlc/files` (priority: `DEVAUDIT_INSTALLER_ROOT` → bundled package snapshot → repo root), instead of probing for `scripts/sdlc-onboard.sh`. The CLI no longer depends on the bash installer existing.

### Removed

- The bash installer (`scripts/sdlc-onboard.sh`, `scripts/sync-sdlc.sh`) has been removed from the repo. `devaudit install` / `devaudit update` are the only supported onboarding/sync path. (`scripts/upload-evidence.sh` stays — it's synced into consumers and bundled here.)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- `devaudit --version` now reports the actual package version instead of a stale hardcoded `0.0.1`. Version is read from `package.json` at build time via a typed JSON import; tsup inlines it into the bundle. The constant can no longer drift from the published version.

### Docs

- `cli/README.md` now leads with the `npm install -g @metasession.co/devaudit-cli` snippet so the npm-registry page guides users straight to install. Status section bumped to 0.1.1.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-19

First public release. Package renamed from `@metasession-dev/devaudit-cli` (GitHub org scope) to `@metasession.co/devaudit-cli` (npm org scope). Repo flipped public; Apache-2.0 licensed. Published to npmjs.org with SLSA provenance.

### Added

- `devaudit push --dry-run` now short-circuits before any portal mutation. The CLI enumerates which evidence files would be uploaded (via the same `collectFiles` logic the live upload uses) and prints them; no POST to `/api/evidence/upload` happens. Operators can safely preview a push before running it for real. Combined with `--json`, dry-run emits a single structured planned payload: `{ dryRun: true, projectSlug, requirementId, evidenceType, baseUrl, files, metadata, ... }`.
- `devaudit auth status --json` emits one parseable JSON object instead of a stream of pretty log lines. Shape: `{ ok: true, source: 'env' | 'file', baseUrl, projects: [...slugs] }` on success; `{ ok: false, reason: 'not_logged_in' | 'portal_rejected' | 'unexpected', ... }` on failure. Prose path unchanged.
- `devaudit status --json` emits one structured object: `{ ok, projectPath, project_slug, stack, host, node_version | python_version, devaudit_base_url, uat_enabled, approval_mode, files_present, files_missing }`. The `not_onboarded` failure path also emits structured JSON when `--json` is set. Useful for piping into other tools.
- `lib/logger.ts` exports `isJsonMode()` and `emitJsonResult(payload)` — small helpers so commands can branch on JSON mode and emit a single result line rather than rely on consola's per-log JSON records.

### Fixed

- `devaudit install --yes` on an existing consumer no longer wipes rich `sdlc-config.json` customizations. Previously the `--yes` path read only 4 fields (`project_slug`, runtime version, `source_dirs`, `working_directory`) and the write step then rebuilt the config from defaults — so re-running install on a customized consumer (e.g. WGB, which has `runner: self-hosted`, `sast_baseline: 6`, `database_service: mongodb`, custom `build_env`, custom `paths_ignore`, etc.) would erase all of those fields. Now `write-config.ts` reads the existing config and merges: wizard-owned fields (stack/host/slug/runtime/source_dirs/working_directory/production_url_secret/devaudit block) always come from the current plan; everything else is preserved if present, defaulted otherwise. `prompts.ts:planFromConfig` also now reads `production_url_secret` from the existing config so the wizard doesn't overwrite a custom-named secret. Caught during the WGB smoke against PR #8; new vitest case in `install.test.ts` seeds a richly customized config and asserts every non-wizard field survives a `--yes` re-install.

### Added

- `devaudit plugin install / list / remove / update` are now functional (slice 3 of workstream D), replacing the previous stubs. `install <git-url>` does `git clone --depth 1` into `~/.config/devaudit/plugins/<derived-name>/`, runs `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`, then validates the manifest via the SDK — on validation failure the directory is rm-rf'd and the operator gets a clear error. `list` discovers plugins under `~/.config/devaudit/plugins/`, prints each loaded plugin's name+version+hooks+commands, and surfaces failed-to-load plugins with their reason. `remove <name>` matches by package name or directory name and removes the dir. `update` runs `git pull --ff-only` + `npm install` in each git-backed plugin dir; non-git plugin dirs are skipped with a warning. Each command accepts an optional `root` override for testability. Portal-registry-backed name resolution (e.g. `devaudit plugin install devaudit-plugin-prisma`) remains pending — see #6.
- Plugin loader (slice 2 of workstream D). New `cli/src/lib/plugin/` module discovers plugins under `~/.config/devaudit/plugins/<name>/`, validates each manifest via `@metasession.co/devaudit-plugin-sdk`'s `validateManifest()`, dynamic-imports each main module, and registers plugin-contributed commands under `devaudit <plugin-name> <sub-cmd>`. `runHook(plugins, hookName, ctx)` is wired into `install` (`beforeInstall` / `afterInstall`), `update` (`beforeSync` / `afterSync`), `push` (`beforePush` / `afterPush`), and `doctor` (`onDoctor`) — per-plugin errors are isolated so a misbehaving plugin can't crash the CLI. CLI now depends on `@metasession.co/devaudit-plugin-sdk` via `file:../plugin-sdk` (CI builds the SDK first). 7 new vitest cases cover discovery, runtime apiVersion mismatch, error isolation, skip on missing hook, and commander command registration. Plugin install/list/remove/update CLI commands stay stubbed pending the portal plugin registry (slice 3+ of workstream D).
- `GitProvider` abstraction (workstream C). New `cli/src/lib/git-provider/` module exports a `GitProvider` interface plus a shipping `GitHubProvider` implementation. The provider prefers the `gh` CLI when on PATH and falls back to direct REST against `api.github.com` (with `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`) for everything except secret-set (sodium encryption required — `gh` CLI must be present for that one op). `detectProvider()` parses `git remote get-url origin` and returns `github` / `gitlab` / `bitbucket` / `self-hosted`; only GitHub is wired up — other hosts throw a clear "not yet supported" error. Install steps 7 (secrets/variables) and 9 (branch protection) refactored to consume `GitProvider`, dropping their direct `execa('gh', …)` calls. 7 new vitest cases plus updated `install.test.ts` (uses a fake provider for injection-style mocking).
- Native TS port of `sdlc-onboard.sh` (workstream A milestone 3). `devaudit install` no longer shells out to bash; each of the 11 onboarding steps lives in its own module under `cli/src/install/`: auth-probe, detect-stack, prompts, write-config, project, api-key, github, hooks-bootstrap, branch-protection, sync-templates, done-report. Orchestrator threads `--dry-run` (planned actions, no mutations) and `--yes` (non-interactive — reads `sdlc-config.json` for defaults). Step 10 reuses the native `syncProject()` so the sync no longer shells out to `sync-sdlc.sh` either. `DevAuditClient.listApiKeys(projectId)` was added so step 6 stays idempotent against a portal-tracked `Onboarding-issued` key. 5 new vitest cases cover dry-run, full-run with mocked HTTP+gh, missing stack, PAT rejection, and the existing-key warn path.

### Planned for v0.1.0

- Native TS port of `sync-sdlc.sh` (workstream A milestone 4) — landed in #7
- `--json` output mode tightened on every command, with a versioned event schema
- `--yes` / `--dry-run` honoured by every mutating command — `install` honors both; other commands TBD
- npm publish (private scope first)

## [0.0.1] — 2026-05-18

First public commit on `metasession-dev/DevAudit-Installer`. Skeleton + working commands per workstream A milestones 1, 2, 5, 6 of [`docs/devaudit-cli/build-plan.md`](../docs/devaudit-cli/build-plan.md).

### Added

- Bootstrap (commit `48916b8`): Node/TS ESM sub-package under `cli/`, commander-based CLI, full command surface registered, common flags (`--json` / `--yes` / `--dry-run` / `--verbose` / `--no-color` / `--org`), consola logger
- `devaudit --help` and `--version` (commander default behaviour)
- `devaudit doctor` — verifies `node>=22`, `git`, `gh`, `jq`, `curl` are on PATH
- `devaudit status [path]` (commit `a133b8b`) — reads `sdlc-config.json` from a consumer project, prints stack/host/slug/source-dirs/devaudit-url/uat-state/approval-mode, and probes 10 framework files for presence
- `devaudit auth login` — interactive PAT paste flow via `@clack/prompts`, validates against `GET /api/projects`, stores at `~/.config/devaudit/auth.json` (mode 0600)
- `devaudit auth logout` — wipes the cached token
- `devaudit auth status` — verifies the cached token (or `DEVAUDIT_USER_TOKEN` env var) via portal
- `devaudit push <slug> <req> <type> <file>` — port of `scripts/upload-evidence.sh`. POST to `/api/evidence/upload` with `Authorization: Bearer DEVAUDIT_API_KEY`, multipart/form-data body. Single file or directory. Retries on 429/5xx with exponential backoff, honours `Retry-After`. All upload-evidence.sh flags preserved.
- `devaudit install [path]` — **v0 wrapper** that shells out to `scripts/sdlc-onboard.sh` with stdio inheritance. Native port pending.
- `devaudit update <version> <paths...>` — **v0 wrapper** that shells out to `scripts/sync-sdlc.sh`. Native port pending.
- 7 vitest tests
- GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/cli.yml` — lint + typecheck + build + test on Linux/macOS/Windows (node 22)

### Stubbed (not implemented; exit code 1 + pointer to build plan)

- `devaudit org list / switch / policy list|apply / report` — needs portal RBAC + policy engine + reporting endpoints (workstream B)
- `devaudit plugin list / install / remove / update` — needs portal plugin registry + plugin SDK (workstream D)
- `devaudit config get / set / list`
- `devaudit upgrade`
