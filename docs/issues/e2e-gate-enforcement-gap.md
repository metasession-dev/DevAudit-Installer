# E2E gate is advisory — no machine-enforced prevention against pushing without running Playwright

## Background

The DevAudit SDLC requires all four gates (TypeScript, SAST, dep-audit, E2E) to pass before pushing to `$INTEGRATION_BRANCH`. The `sdlc-implementer` skill's Phase 2 step 5 explicitly lists `npx playwright test` as a gate that must run "once, after the fast gates are clean."

Multiple issues have been implemented to strengthen E2E test discipline:

- **#132** — Pre-test-work declaration gate + post-hoc self-audit in Phase 2 (prose-level enforcement)
- **#170** — Phase 5½ evidence wiring validation (checks `evidenceShot()` / `tagTest()` / `@requirement` annotations)
- **#196** — `tagTest()` helper for REQ/AC tagging
- **#174** — Feature-branch in-scope E2E via `feature-e2e.yml` (CI-time only)
- **#169** — Evidence-completeness gate in `upload-evidence` job (CI-time only)
- **#211** — 18 control gaps across all phases
- **#212** — Requirements gap classification

Despite all these fixes, a real-world deployment in `wawagardenbar-app` demonstrated that the E2E gate can be silently skipped:

1. The `sdlc-implementer` skill (or operator) ran TypeScript, vitest, semgrep, and npm audit
2. The E2E suite (`npx playwright test`) was **never executed**
3. The skill noted "I did not run the Playwright E2E suite" but still committed and pushed
4. The E2E spec was unverified — selectors, routes, and DB seed structure were all guessed
5. The `e2e-test-engineer` skill was never invoked, so its scenario-derivation, convention-matching, and suite-execution discipline never fired

## Scenarios that break the skill-driven workflow

The wawagardenbar-app deployments (first failure and PR #413) are not isolated incidents. They are instances of a broader pattern: the skill-driven SDLC workflow breaks whenever the native agent must step outside the skill's file-read/write boundary. The following taxonomy maps all observed failure modes.

### 1. Environment setup & infrastructure

- **MongoDB/Redis/Postgres not running** — permission issues, stale locks, wrong ports, missing binaries
- **Missing system dependencies** — Playwright browsers not installed, `mongod` not on PATH, missing native libraries
- **Port conflicts** — another process occupying 3000, 27017, etc.
- **Filesystem permission errors** — can't write to `/var/lib/mongodb`, `/tmp` full, read-only mounts

### 2. Test debugging iteration loops

- **E2E tests fail against a live dev server** — need to inspect page snapshots, error contexts, DOM structure, then adjust locators/selectors and re-run. Each iteration requires: read error → edit test → restart server (sometimes) → re-run → read new error. This tight loop is impossible without direct environment access.
- **Test data doesn't match Mongoose schema** — e.g. `OrderItemsTable` crashed because test orders were missing `subtotal`, `dineInDetails`, `guestName`, `statusHistory`. Discovering this requires seeing the runtime error dialog in the browser, which only the native agent can do.
- **Flaky parallel tests** — tests pass in isolation but fail in parallel due to shared DB state. Requires re-running, adjusting test isolation, adding cleanup.

### 3. CI feedback loops

- **CI compliance validation failures** — CI expects artifacts in `compliance/evidence/` but skills put them in `compliance/plans/`. Requires reading CI logs, understanding the validator script, creating/copying files, pushing again.
- **CI semgrep findings above baseline** — requires reading the finding, deciding if it's a false positive, adjusting code or baseline, re-running.
- **CI TypeScript errors** — `tsc --noEmit` catches type errors that only appear in the CI environment (different Node version, different tsconfig resolution).
- **CI npm audit failures** — new vulnerability published between local run and CI run.

### 4. Git & GitHub operations

- **Commit message format rejections** — husky/commitlint rejects non-conventional formats. Requires understanding the configured enum and retrying.
- **Pre-push hook failures** — TypeScript check or lint-staged fails, blocking push. Requires fixing the issue and re-pushing.
- **Merge conflicts** — `develop` diverged while working on a feature branch. Requires conflict resolution.
- **PR creation** — `gh pr create` with the right title, body, labels, reviewers.

### 5. External service interactions

- **DevAudit portal approval** — can't be done from code; requires human login to the portal
- **Railway deployment status** — checking if deploy succeeded, reading build logs, diagnosing startup failures
- **UAT health checks** — curling the UAT URL, verifying the app is responsive
- **Monnify webhook mocking** — E2E tests for gateway payments would require either mocking the webhook or using a test API key

### 6. Skill workflow gaps

- **Directory convention mismatches** — skills say `compliance/plans/`, CI validates `compliance/evidence/`. The skill doesn't know about the CI validator's expectations.
- **Missing Phase 1 artifacts** — `sdlc-implementer` should create `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` during planning, but if the native agent skips Phase 1 or rushes through it, these get missed.
- **Skill can't verify its own output** — the skill can write an artifact file, but can't run `./scripts/validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` to check if it would pass CI.

### 7. Cross-skill handoff failures

- **e2e-test-engineer writes tests but can't run them** — it can design and author test files, but executing `npx playwright test` requires the native agent's environment access.
- **sdlc-implementer delegates but loses track** — after delegating to e2e-test-engineer, the native agent continues without re-invoking sdlc-implementer for subsequent phases (exactly what happened in PR #413).

### Root causes

All of these fall into two root causes:

1. **Skills lack environment access** — they can read/write files and provide instructions, but can't run commands, start services, inspect browser state, or interact with external APIs. The native agent bridges this gap but doesn't re-invoke the skill after the fix, losing the workflow structure.
2. **Skills lack feedback loops** — they can produce artifacts but can't verify them against CI validators, test runners, or deployment targets. The native agent bridges this gap but doesn't re-invoke the skill after the fix, losing the workflow structure.

The changes in this issue (1–11) address the *symptoms* — missing sentinels, missing artifacts, wrong directories, no re-invocation protocol. The root causes (environment access and feedback loops) are architectural limitations of the skill mechanism itself. Six architectural decisions (below) define the direction for resolving them; some are implementable now as skill-level changes, others are future architectural work.

## Architectural decisions

Six architectural decisions were resolved to address the root causes. Each decision shapes how the required changes are implemented.

### Decision 1: Should skills execute commands? — **B: Command manifest**

Skills gain a "command manifest" — the skill declares commands it needs (e.g. `npx playwright test`, `npm run dev`, `./scripts/validate-compliance-artifacts.sh`), the native agent executes them and returns output to the skill. The skill stays in control of the workflow but delegates execution.

- **Rejected: A (pure instructions)** — relies on discipline, native agent can "forget" to re-invoke the skill (PR #413).
- **Rejected: C (executable agents)** — breaks "skill as portable markdown" design, security concerns, major architecture overhaul.
- **Implementation status:** Future architectural work. The current issue's changes are designed to be compatible with this direction (e.g. the resume protocol in Change 9, the explicit boundary in Change 11) but the command manifest itself is not implemented here.

### Decision 2: Re-invocation protocol after environment detours? — **B: Resume protocol**

After an environment detour, the native agent must call `Skill(name: "sdlc-implementer", args: "resume REQ-XXX — environment detour complete, re-enter at Phase N")`. The skill re-reads state (git log, file tree, RTM, existing artifacts) and continues from where it left off. The skill must be idempotent on re-entry — re-reading state rather than assuming prior context.

- **Rejected: A (phase-transition sentinel)** — bypassable, doesn't verify the skill drove the phase, just that the sentinel line exists.
- **Rejected: C (state file checkpoints)** — adds state management burden, too much ceremony.
- **Implementation:** Change 9 (revised) — replaces the phase-transition sentinel with a resume protocol in SKILL.md.

### Decision 3: Directory convention unification? — **C: Phase 3 copy**

Phase 1 writes `implementation-plan.md` to `compliance/plans/REQ-XXX/`. Phase 3 copies it to `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/`. Preserves the semantic distinction (plans = working documents, evidence = uploaded artifacts). With the resume protocol (Decision 2B), Phase 3 is more likely to run under skill control.

- **Rejected: A (write to evidence/ directly)** — breaks the plans/evidence semantic distinction.
- **Rejected: B (CI checks both locations)** — plan still needs to reach evidence/ for portal upload, doesn't solve the upload pipeline gap.
- **Implementation:** Change 8 (unchanged).

### Decision 4: Local CI validator as a skill step? — **B: Pre-push hook runs validator**

The pre-push hook (already checking E2E evidence and skill sentinel) adds a third check: run `validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` and block push if it fails. Machine-enforced, fires before push, no skill architecture change needed. Catches the PR #413 failure class (missing `test-scope.md`, `test-plan.md`, `implementation-plan.md`) before the push lands.

- **Rejected: A (prose-level verify step)** — same class of gap as the original E2E gate problem, can be skipped.
- **Rejected: C (skill calls validator via command manifest)** — requires Decision 1B to be implemented first.
- **Implementation:** Change 10 (new) — add compliance validator check to pre-push hook.

### Decision 5: Boundary between skill and native agent? — **A: Explicit in SKILL.md**

Add a "Native agent responsibilities" section listing what the skill expects the native agent to handle (command execution, environment debugging, service startup) and a "Re-invocation protocol" section specifying when the native agent must hand control back (after environment detours, before phase transitions). Pairs with the resume protocol (Decision 2B) — the boundary section tells the native agent *when* to resume, the resume protocol tells it *how*.

- **Rejected: B (structural boundary)** — adds ceremony to every step, many steps are already implicitly "native agent executes this".
- **Rejected: C (no explicit boundary)** — status quo that PR #413 demonstrated doesn't work.
- **Implementation:** Change 11 (new) — add boundary and re-invocation protocol sections to SKILL.md.

### Decision 6: `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` — separate files or plan sections? — **A: Extract in Phase 1**

Phase 1 step 5b mechanically extracts the AC table → `test-scope.md` and test file listing → `test-plan.md` from the implementation plan. Files exist before E2E execution in Phase 2, so they can be reviewed and updated before tests run.

- **Rejected: B (CI accepts plan sections)** — couples CI to plan structure, affects portal upload pipeline.
- **Rejected: C (generate in Phase 3)** — too late, test scope is needed before E2E runs in Phase 2.
- **Implementation:** Change 7 (revised) — extract in Phase 1 with drift management protocol (see below).

#### Drift management protocol

The scope-expansion halt already updates `test-scope.md` on option (b). But it doesn't mention `test-plan.md`. The drift management protocol ensures extracted files stay in sync with the plan:

1. **Any AC change in `implementation-plan.md` triggers a re-extraction** — the skill re-runs the Phase 1 step 5b extraction to regenerate `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` from the updated plan.
2. **The scope-expansion halt (option b) explicitly re-extracts both files** — add `test-plan.md` to the existing list of files updated on scope amendment (currently only mentions `test-scope.md` / `implementation-plan.md`).
3. **Phase 2 step 5b (E2E gate verification) checks for plan ↔ test-scope consistency** — before running E2E, verify the AC table in `implementation-plan.md` matches `test-scope.md`. If they diverge, halt: "test-scope.md is out of sync with implementation-plan.md. Re-extract before running E2E."

This makes drift a **machine-caught halt**, not a silent inconsistency. The check is simple — compare the AC IDs in both files. If they don't match, the skill halts.

| When | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| Phase 1 step 5b | Extract `test-scope.md` + `test-plan.md` from plan |
| Phase 2 scope-expansion (option b) | Update plan → re-extract both files → invalidate evidence |
| Phase 2 step 5b (pre-E2E) | Check plan ↔ test-scope AC consistency → halt if diverged |
| Pre-push hook (Change 10) | Run `validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` → blocks if files missing |

## Problem statement

Every existing defence is either:

- **Prose-level** — the skill's instructions say "MUST invoke" and "MUST run gates", but nothing prevents the skill (or operator) from skipping a gate and pushing anyway. The #132 declaration gate and self-audit are structural prompts, not machine-enforced checks.
- **CI-time only** — `feature-e2e.yml` and the evidence-completeness gate (#169) catch missing E2E evidence *after* the push lands on `develop` or after a PR is opened. By then, the commit is on the integration branch and the release record may already exist.
- **Post-hoc** — #170's Phase 5½ validation checks evidence wiring *after* specs are written, not whether the suite was actually *run*.

The missing layer is **pre-push enforcement**: a mechanism that refuses to push to `$INTEGRATION_BRANCH` if the E2E gate was never run locally.

## Root cause analysis

### Why prose gates aren't enough

The #132 gates work by forcing the agent to output a literal declaration line (`Delegating e2e test work to e2e-test-engineer.`) and then blocking direct spec authoring. But:

1. The agent can output the declaration and still not run the suite — the declaration is about *authoring*, not *executing*
2. The self-audit (Phase 2 step 9) checks whether specs were authored via the skill, not whether `npx playwright test` was actually run
3. Neither gate has a machine-enforced failure mode — the skill can rationalise around them ("I'll run E2E later", "CI will catch it")

### Why CI-time gates aren't enough

CI gates fire *after* the push. The sequence is:

1. Skill skips E2E gate locally
2. Skill pushes to `develop`
3. CI registers the release on the portal (via `register-release` job with `--create-release-if-missing`)
4. CI runs E2E — which may fail
5. But the release record already exists, and for housekeeping versions, the housekeeping stub PR is already opening

The release record existing on the portal before E2E passes is an audit-trail problem — the portal shows a release that was created from a push where gates weren't verified locally.

### The enforcement gap

There is no mechanism today that:
- Verifies `npx playwright test` was run (e.g., checks for `playwright-report/` or a test results artifact) before allowing a push
- Verifies the `e2e-test-engineer` skill was actually invoked (e.g., checks chat transcript for the skill invocation)
- Blocks a push at the git-hook level if E2E evidence is missing

## Proposed solutions

### Option 1: Pre-push hook with E2E evidence check

Add a pre-push hook (husky `pre-push` for node stacks) that checks for recent E2E evidence before allowing pushes to `$INTEGRATION_BRANCH`:

- Checks for `playwright-report/` directory with files newer than the last commit
- If no E2E evidence found and the change touches `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` or any UI-facing source files, refuses the push
- Can be bypassed with `--no-verify` (documented as a last resort, not a habit)

**Pros:** Machine-enforced, fires before the push, catches the exact failure mode
**Cons:** `--no-verify` bypass exists; doesn't verify the *quality* of the E2E run (just that it ran); adds friction to legitimate non-E2E changes

### Option 2: CI-side pre-registration gate

Modify `ci.yml.template` so the `register-release` job does **not** create the release until E2E gates pass:

- Move `--create-release-if-missing` from `register-release` to `upload-evidence` (which runs after gates)
- The release record only appears on the portal after all gates (including E2E) are green
- This doesn't prevent the push, but prevents the portal from showing a release until E2E passes

**Pros:** No local hook needed; portal audit trail is clean; release record only exists for verified pushes
**Cons:** Doesn't address the local gate skip; CI still runs E2E on a push that should have been verified locally; changes the release registration timing (may affect other workflows)

### Option 3: Skill-level E2E gate verification

Add a verification step to `sdlc-implementer` Phase 2 that checks for E2E run evidence before allowing the push:

- After step 5 (run gates), check for `playwright-report/` or a sentinel file (e.g., `.e2e-gate-passed`)
- If the change touches UI-facing files and no E2E evidence exists, halt with: "E2E gate was not run. Operator action — run `npx playwright test` before pushing."
- The sentinel file approach: `e2e-test-engineer` writes `.e2e-gate-passed` after a successful run; `sdlc-implementer` checks for it before pushing; `.gitignore`'d so it doesn't pollute the repo

**Pros:** Fits the existing skill architecture; no CI changes; catches the gap at the skill level
**Cons:** Still advisory (skill can rationalise around it); doesn't help if the skill isn't invoked at all

### Option 4: Combined approach (recommended)

Combine Options 1 + 2:

- **Pre-push hook** (Option 1) catches the local skip — the most common failure mode
- **CI-side pre-registration gate** (Option 2) ensures the portal never shows a release from an unverified push — defence in depth
- **Skill-level verification** (Option 3) adds a clear halt point in the skill flow

## Recommended approach

**Option 4 (combined)** — the pre-push hook is the primary defence, the CI-side pre-registration gate is the safety net, and the skill-level verification provides a clear halt point. Each layer catches what the others miss:

| Layer | Catches | Misses |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Skill-level verification (Option 3) | Skill skipping E2E gate | Operator working without the skill |
| Pre-push hook (Option 1) | Any push without E2E evidence | `--no-verify` bypass |
| CI-side pre-registration (Option 2) | Portal showing unverified releases | Doesn't prevent the push itself |

## Skill-invocation enforcement (devaudit-installer#199 follow-up)

A related but distinct gap was identified during the wawagardenbar-app post-mortem: despite #199's mandatory prompt gate, the `sdlc-implementer` skill was never invoked — the operator manually read the SDLC workflow files and executed the steps themselves. This bypassed all skill-level delegation gates (#132) and the E2E gate.

#199 enforces the **output** (commits have REQ tags via commitlint + `validate-commits.sh`) but not the **process** (sdlc-implementer skill was actually invoked). The prompt gate is prose-level — it depends on the AI agent reading and complying with a system-prompt instruction. There is no machine-enforced verification that the skill was invoked.

Two additional changes address this:

### 5. Skill invocation sentinel + pre-push hook check

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md` (write sentinel), `sdlc/files/stacks/node/hooks/pre-push` (check sentinel)

**Logic:**
- `sdlc-implementer` writes `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` (gitignored) at Phase 0 start
- The pre-push hook (from change #1) also checks for this sentinel when `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`perf` commits are present
- If no sentinel exists, refuses the push with: "sdlc-implementer skill was not invoked. This change uses feat/fix commit types which require the SDLC skill flow. Invoke sdlc-implementer or use --no-verify to bypass (not recommended)."
- Bypass with `--no-verify` is possible but logged

### 6. RTM provenance stamp + CI validation

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md` (write provenance), `sdlc/files/_common/scripts/validate-commits.sh` (check provenance)

**Logic:**
- `sdlc-implementer` Phase 1 step 9 (update RTM.md) adds a provenance marker to the RTM row: `| REQ-XXX | <title> | <risk> | #<issue> | <tests> | sdlc-implementer@<version> |`
- `validate-commits.sh` (CI gate, `--no-verify` cannot skip) extracts the REQ-XXX from the commit message, looks up the RTM row, and checks for the provenance marker
- If the REQ-XXX has no provenance stamp, fails CI with: "REQ-XXX in commit message has no sdlc-implementer provenance in RTM.md. The skill was not invoked. Either invoke sdlc-implementer and re-run, or add the provenance marker manually with operator sign-off."
- This is the unskippable safety net — catches `--no-verify` bypass of the pre-push hook and non-husky stacks

## Required changes

### 1. Pre-push hook with E2E evidence check

**File:** `sdlc/files/stacks/node/hooks/pre-push` (synced to consumer's `.husky/pre-push`)

**Logic:**
- Detect if the push targets `$INTEGRATION_BRANCH` (develop)
- Check if any changed files match UI-facing patterns (e.g., `src/**/*.tsx`, `app/**/*.tsx`, `pages/**/*.tsx`)
- If UI-facing files changed, check for `playwright-report/` with files newer than the last commit
- If no E2E evidence found, refuse the push with a clear message
- Allow bypass via `--no-verify` (documented as last resort)

### 2. Move release registration after E2E gates

**File:** `sdlc/files/ci/ci.yml.template`

**Change:** Remove `--create-release-if-missing` from the `register-release` job's "Ensure release exists" step. Add a new "Register release" step in the `upload-evidence` job (which runs after gates) that creates the release with `--create-release-if-missing`.

### 3. Skill-level E2E gate verification

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md`

**Change:** Add a verification sub-step between Phase 2 step 5 (run gates) and step 7 (commit) that:
- Checks for `playwright-report/` directory existence
- If the change touches UI-facing files and the directory is missing, halts with: "E2E gate was not run. Run `npx playwright test` before committing."
- If the change is non-UI (e.g., API-only, config, docs), skip the check with a noted exemption

### 4. Update `e2e-test-engineer` to write a sentinel

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/e2e-test-engineer/SKILL.md`

**Change:** After a successful E2E run, write a `.e2e-gate-passed` sentinel file (gitignored) that the pre-push hook and skill-level verification can check for as an alternative to `playwright-report/` existence.

### 5. Skill invocation sentinel + pre-push hook check

(See skill-invocation enforcement section above)

### 6. RTM provenance stamp + CI validation

(See skill-invocation enforcement section above)

## Phase-artifact creation gaps (discovered in wawagardenbar-app PR #413)

A second real-world deployment in `wawagardenbar-app` (PR #413) revealed three additional gaps that the original six changes do not address. In this deployment, `sdlc-implementer` **was** invoked and drove Phase 1 (planning) and Phase 2 (implementation) correctly. The E2E suite was delegated to `e2e-test-engineer`. The failure occurred later, after an environment debugging detour (MongoDB port conflict, dev server startup, Playwright browser install) forced the native agent to take over hands-on debugging. The native agent then continued through Phase 3 (evidence) and Phase 4 (PR) without re-invoking `sdlc-implementer`. CI Compliance Validation failed with 3 missing files.

### Gap A: `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` are never created by any skill step

`validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` (CI) hard-fails if `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-scope.md` or `test-plan.md` are missing. The PR review checklist in `4-submit-for-review.md` also requires them. The scope-expansion halt in `sdlc-implementer` references `test-scope.md` as if it always exists.

But no step in `sdlc-implementer` (Phase 1 or Phase 3) or any sub-skill creates these files. The implementation plan template (`Implementation_Plan_TEMPLATE.md`) contains acceptance criteria and test strategy sections that are the natural source for these artifacts, but the skill never extracts them into separate files.

**This gap would cause CI failure even with perfect skill invocation end-to-end.** The skill can drive Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 correctly and still fail Compliance Validation because these files were never created.

### Gap B: `implementation-plan.md` location mismatch

`sdlc-implementer` Phase 1 step 5 writes `implementation-plan.md` to `compliance/plans/REQ-XXX/implementation-plan.md`. But `validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` checks `compliance/evidence/$REQ/implementation-plan.md`. Phase 3 step 6 organises artifacts under `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/` but the listed artifacts don't include `implementation-plan.md` — so it's never copied.

### Gap C: No re-invocation enforcement after environment detour

The `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` sentinel (Change 5) is written once at Phase 0. It proves the skill was invoked *at some point*, not that it drove *every* phase. After an environment debugging detour (MongoDB, dev server, Playwright install), the native agent continued through Phase 3 and Phase 4 without re-invoking the skill. The sentinel check passes. The RTM provenance check passes. But the skill's Phase 3 artifact checklist — which might have caught the missing files — was never run by the skill.

This is the same class of gap as the original E2E gate problem: prose-level enforcement says "auto-continue to Phase 3" (Phase 2 step 11), but nothing enforces that the *skill* does the continuing vs. the native agent doing it manually.

## Additional required changes (from PR #413 findings)

### 7. Create `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` in `sdlc-implementer` Phase 1 (Architectural Decision 6A)

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md`

**Change:** Add a new step after Phase 1 step 5 (write implementation plan) that extracts the acceptance criteria and test strategy from the plan into two separate files under `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/`:
- `test-scope.md` — acceptance criteria (AC table from the plan), risk classification, verification methods per AC
- `test-plan.md` — test file listing, which ACs each file covers, test depth per risk class

These are derived from the implementation plan's existing sections (Acceptance Criteria, Test Strategy). The extraction is mechanical — the skill already authors this content in the plan; it just needs to write it to the CI-expected location as separate files.

**Drift management protocol:**

1. **Any AC change in `implementation-plan.md` triggers a re-extraction** — the skill re-runs the Phase 1 step 5b extraction to regenerate `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` from the updated plan.
2. **The scope-expansion halt (option b) explicitly re-extracts both files** — add `test-plan.md` to the existing list of files updated on scope amendment (currently only mentions `test-scope.md` / `implementation-plan.md`).
3. **Phase 2 step 5b (E2E gate verification) checks for plan ↔ test-scope consistency** — before running E2E, verify the AC table in `implementation-plan.md` matches `test-scope.md`. If they diverge, halt: "test-scope.md is out of sync with implementation-plan.md. Re-extract before running E2E."

This makes drift a **machine-caught halt**, not a silent inconsistency. The check is simple — compare the AC IDs in both files. If they don't match, the skill halts.

| When | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| Phase 1 step 5b | Extract `test-scope.md` + `test-plan.md` from plan |
| Phase 2 scope-expansion (option b) | Update plan → re-extract both files → invalidate evidence |
| Phase 2 step 5b (pre-E2E) | Check plan ↔ test-scope AC consistency → halt if diverged |
| Pre-push hook (Change 10) | Run `validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` → blocks if files missing |

### 8. Copy `implementation-plan.md` to `compliance/evidence/` in Phase 3

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md`

**Change:** In Phase 3 step 6 (organise artefacts), add `implementation-plan.md` to the list of files placed under `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/`. The skill should copy (not move) the file from `compliance/plans/REQ-XXX/` so the plan directory retains the original.

### 9. Resume protocol — re-invocation enforcement (Architectural Decision 2B)

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md`

**Change:** Replace the single `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` sentinel (Change 5) with a resume protocol. The skill still writes the sentinel at Phase 0 to prove invocation, but the core enforcement is the resume protocol:

- After an environment detour (MongoDB, dev server, Playwright install, test debugging), the native agent must call `Skill(name: "sdlc-implementer", args: "resume REQ-XXX — environment detour complete, re-enter at Phase N")`.
- The skill re-reads state (git log, file tree, RTM, existing artifacts in `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/`) and continues from where it left off.
- The skill must be idempotent on re-entry — re-reading state rather than assuming prior context. Specifically:
  - Re-read `compliance/RTM.md` to confirm REQ-XXX row exists and has provenance stamp.
  - Re-read `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/` to see which artifacts already exist.
  - Check `git log` for commits already made on this branch.
  - Resume at the appropriate phase: if Phase 2 implementation is complete but Phase 3 artifacts are missing, resume at Phase 3 step 1.
- The skill's Phase 2 step 11 (auto-continue to Phase 3) is updated to explicitly state: "If you are resuming after an environment detour, re-read state before continuing. Do not assume prior context is valid."

The pre-push hook (Change 5) still checks for the `.sdlc-implementer-invoked` sentinel as a baseline — it proves the skill was invoked at least once. The resume protocol ensures the skill re-enters after detours, not just that it was invoked once.

### 10. Pre-push hook runs compliance validator (Architectural Decision 4B)

**File:** `sdlc/files/stacks/node/hooks/pre-push`

**Change:** Add a fourth check to the pre-push hook: run `./scripts/validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` and block push if it fails. This catches the PR #413 failure class — missing `test-scope.md`, `test-plan.md`, `implementation-plan.md` in `compliance/evidence/` — before the push lands.

Logic:
- After the E2E evidence check and skill sentinel check, run `bash scripts/validate-compliance-artifacts.sh origin/develop`
- If the validator exits non-zero, refuse the push with: "Compliance artifact validation failed. Missing or incomplete artifacts. Run './scripts/validate-compliance-artifacts.sh' locally to see details. Bypass with --no-verify (last resort, not a habit)."
- This check fires for all pushes to `$INTEGRATION_BRANCH`, not just UI-facing changes — compliance artifacts are required for any tracked REQ.

### 11. Explicit skill/native-agent boundary in SKILL.md (Architectural Decision 5A)

**File:** `sdlc/files/_common/skills/sdlc-implementer/SKILL.md`

**Change:** Add two new sections to SKILL.md:

**"Native agent responsibilities" section:**
- Command execution — running `npx playwright test`, `npm run dev`, `mongod`, etc.
- Environment debugging — port conflicts, stale locks, missing binaries, Playwright browser installs
- Browser inspection — reading page snapshots, DOM state, error dialogs during E2E debugging
- External service interaction — Railway deploy status, UAT health checks, DevAudit portal (human-only)
- Git operations — merge conflicts, push retries

**"Re-invocation protocol" section:**
- After any environment detour (service startup, test debugging iteration, CI failure fix), the native agent must re-invoke `sdlc-implementer` with `Skill(name: "sdlc-implementer", args: "resume REQ-XXX — <detour description>, re-enter at Phase N")`.
- The skill re-reads state and continues from the appropriate phase.
- The native agent must NOT continue to the next phase (Phase 3 → Phase 4, Phase 2 → Phase 3) without re-invoking the skill.
- The only exception: the skill's own "auto-continue" steps (Phase 2 step 11) where the skill explicitly says it will continue to the next phase in the same turn.

## Acceptance criteria (additional, from PR #413 findings + architectural decisions)

### Phase-artifact creation (Decision 6A)
- [ ] `sdlc-implementer` Phase 1 step 5b creates `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-scope.md` with AC table, risk class, and verification methods
- [ ] `sdlc-implementer` Phase 1 step 5b creates `compliance/evidence/REQ-XXX/test-plan.md` with test file listing and AC coverage mapping
- [ ] `sdlc-implementer` Phase 3 step 6 copies `implementation-plan.md` from `compliance/plans/` to `compliance/evidence/`
- [ ] Test: a REQ driven through Phase 1 by `sdlc-implementer` produces `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md` in `compliance/evidence/`
- [ ] Test: `validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` passes when `sdlc-implementer` drives the full Phase 1 → Phase 3 flow

### Drift management (Decision 6A)
- [ ] Any AC change in `implementation-plan.md` triggers re-extraction of `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md`
- [ ] Scope-expansion halt (option b) explicitly re-extracts both `test-scope.md` and `test-plan.md`
- [ ] Phase 2 step 5b checks plan ↔ test-scope AC consistency before running E2E
- [ ] Test: diverged AC IDs between plan and test-scope.md cause a halt before E2E
- [ ] Test: re-extraction after scope expansion produces consistent files

### Resume protocol (Decision 2B)
- [ ] `sdlc-implementer` SKILL.md documents the resume protocol: `Skill(name: "sdlc-implementer", args: "resume REQ-XXX — <description>, re-enter at Phase N")`
- [ ] Skill is idempotent on re-entry — re-reads git log, file tree, RTM, existing artifacts
- [ ] Phase 2 step 11 updated to instruct re-reading state after environment detours
- [ ] Test: skill resumed after environment detour re-reads state and continues at correct phase
- [ ] Test: skill resumed when Phase 3 artifacts are missing resumes at Phase 3 step 1

### Pre-push hook runs compliance validator (Decision 4B)
- [ ] Pre-push hook runs `./scripts/validate-compliance-artifacts.sh` as a fourth check
- [ ] Push is blocked if compliance validator exits non-zero
- [ ] Test: a push with missing `test-scope.md` is blocked by the pre-push hook
- [ ] Test: a push with all compliance artifacts present passes the pre-push hook

### Explicit skill/native-agent boundary (Decision 5A)
- [ ] SKILL.md includes "Native agent responsibilities" section listing command execution, environment debugging, browser inspection, external services, git operations
- [ ] SKILL.md includes "Re-invocation protocol" section specifying when native agent must hand control back
- [ ] Re-invocation protocol states native agent must NOT continue to next phase without re-invoking skill
- [ ] Exception documented for skill's own auto-continue steps (Phase 2 step 11)
- [ ] Test: SKILL.md boundary section is present and references the resume protocol

## Out of scope

- **Command manifest architecture (Decision 1B)** — skills declaring commands for the native agent to execute is the chosen architectural direction, but implementing it requires changes to the skill mechanism itself (Claude Code Skills). Tracked here as direction; implementation is future work.
- Enforcing E2E for non-node stacks (python pre-commit hooks would need a separate implementation)
- Verifying E2E test *quality* (coverage, assertion depth) — this issue is about whether the suite *ran*, not whether it's comprehensive
- Portal-side changes to release record creation timing (portal API already supports late creation)
- Removing `--no-verify` bypass (this is a git-level feature that can't be disabled)
- Implementation plan watermark (Option 3 from skill-invocation analysis) — redundant with RTM provenance check; the RTM row is the single source of truth for REQ metadata

## Dependencies

- None blocking. The pre-push hook is additive (new hook content). The CI change is a relocation of `--create-release-if-missing` within the same workflow template. The skill changes are prose additions.
